# How to use

Clone this repo inside the .vim folder:

```
git clone http://github.com/fabiogoro/vimrc.git ~/.vim
```

Download Vundle, a plugin manager for vim:

```
git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
```

Then open vim and run:

```
:PluginInstall
```

That's it.
Feel free to use it as you wish.
Any doubts just ask me.
