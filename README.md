# vimrc
My vim config file

# How to use
Download Vundle, a plugin manager for vim:

```
git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
```

Clone this repo inside the .vim folder:

```
git clone git@github.com:fabiogoro/vimrc.git ~/.vim
```

Then open vim and run:

```
:PluginInstall
```

That's it.
Feel free to use it as you wish.
Any doubts just ask me.
